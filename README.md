# Project Overview

The Udacity overview for this project states: In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## Why this Project for TDD?

The Udacity states: Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## What I learned

To use Jasmine to write and run a number of tests against a pre-existing application successfully for behavior-driven development an extension of TDD that is more user focused. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation. I had fun using ES6 arrow functions syntax () => {} during this project.


## Built and Tested With

Languages:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Testing Framework:

Jasmine 


## Installation

Feel free to download the Feed Reader project to your machine.
Jasmine is there already included and installed.

1. Download the repository as a zip-file, extract it and open the index.html in your browser to run the Feed Reader Testing. 

2. Clone the repository with Git Bash, first cd into the directory you wish to store your project in then run the command: ```$ git clone https://github.com/MarthaTaylor/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader``` and go to the folder, open the index.html in your browser to run the RSS Feed Reader Tests.

## External Code Used in this Project

The resources at the following links helped me to get a better understanding of the arcade game project:

The starter code for this project comes from the following [Udacity Frontend Feed Reader repository](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader). I forked and cloned it to my laptop. Creating the origin connection to the remote repository and pushed up my work to my remote repository here on GitHub.

The basic functions were taken from a mixture or [Mathew Cranford](www.mathewcranford.com) and [Mohamed Riaad's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=Ut_L8YUImbw&index=6&list=PLpRo6-g-F-AOUsTQbKY1EYNpqXtxCT4a-&t=27s).

Some code from [Daniela Kuester](https://github.com/DanielaKuester) project thanks Daniella for helping me understand async calls with arrow functions


## Credits

The Udacity course work, written tutorials by Mathew Cranford and youtube Study Jam by Mohamed Riaad, Jasmine Documentation and article from  helped me to get a good overview and understanding of the feed reader project and there approachs to TDD was insightful. 

The [JavaScript Testing](https://eu.udacity.com/course/javascript-testing--ud549) course gives a solid introduction into testing with Jasmine.

The [Jasmine Documentation](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite) is excellent 

An overview of TDD and Jasmine's plus [Jasmines default matchers](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/how-to-test-javascript-with-jasmine-framework-2e2b8dfa7a9e) written by Delores Diei which is very handy.

# Acknowledgements

Big thanks to all who support me during my projects at Udacity, at home and on the web. 

Especially my student group at Udacity/Google Scholarship Slack workspace and all of my study groups! 

An article outlining an overview of TDD and Jasmine's plus [Jasmines default matchers](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/how-to-test-javascript-with-jasmine-framework-2e2b8dfa7a9e) written by Delores Diei which is very handy, thanks Delores. The Jasmine documentation writers who ever you are you really made it easier to grasp the tool, thank you.

A special shout out to the talented Mathew Cranford for his awesome teaching written tutorials abilities and my code reviewer, thank you!
